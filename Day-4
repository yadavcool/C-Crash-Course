/*Goal: use logical and relational operators in a C++ program. 
**Find all possible outputs for the given expression
**Hint: there are three inputs, so there are 8 possible input combinations (2^3)
**Which means there is an output for each combination of inputs.
**The expression: (A and B and C) or (A and( (not B) or (not C))) = Q
*/

The questions: 
/*Goal: practice if-else statements in C++
**Write a program to select the best pet. 
*/
"Do you want a pet with fur(f), feathers(t), or scales(s)?" 
"You want a pet with scales. Do you want the pet to live in water(w), on land(l), or both(b)? 
The pet choices should be: dog, bird, fish, gecko, frog

Create a program that asks the user for two float numbers. Then asks the user if they would like to:

add the numbers
subtract the numbers
multiply the numbers
divide the numbers
The program should then print the numbers with the chosen operation and the solution. 
For example:

The user enters: 4 5 +
The program will output: 4 + 5 = 9


4>
Write a program that asks a user for five numbers.
Print out the sum and average of the five numbers.

5>
/*Goal: In the programming quiz, use a while loop to prompt
**the user to guess a target number. 
**Tell the user if the guess is too high or too low. 
**The user enters -1  or guesses the target number to end 
**the program.
